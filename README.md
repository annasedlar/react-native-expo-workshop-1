## Assignments

#### 1) Show original date
By default, photos show a "hours ago" format ("15 hours ago"). Your job is to make a press handler that will turn the date to the original ISO formatted format ("2016-12-01T18:05:26").

#### 2) Handle like press

When the user taps on the _heart icon_, the number of likes should increase by 1 and the icon should turn filled red.

#### 3) Show multiple photos in the feed

For this project, photos are being fetched from a local file `photos.json`. But the app by default is showing just the first one. Change it to show all the photos in a Scrollable View.

#### 4) Add comments

Comments are displayed in an Alert when the comments icon is pressed. Implement the feature to add comments.

#### 5) Refresh indicator

Once you have multiple photos in place, when the user scrolls down forcing an update, you should display the loading indicator.

#### 6) Share function

Make the top-right share icon in each picture work.
